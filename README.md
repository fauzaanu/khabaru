# khabaru

khabaru expands on fauzaanu/onlydjango repo by making it more focused towards a news application. 

## Goals

- [ ] Translation of wagtail to dhivehi

I have translated 60% of wagtail to dhivehi, however until this is finished khabaru will have to use a custom admin and no wagtail.

- [ ] Custom Admin

The custom admin interface is also not at a finished state. Anyone can use this as a starter regardless of the incomplete state. (while doing so, consider contributing to the project)

- [ ] Deploy and then customize

A scenerio where people can just deploy a basic version of this repo through railway and then hire a developer to customize it further would be a great goal.

```bash
sudo docker rm -f $(sudo docker ps -aq) && sudo docker compose -f dev.docker-compose.yml up -d
```
